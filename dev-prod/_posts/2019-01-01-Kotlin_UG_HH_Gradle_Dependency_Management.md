The Java ecosystem allows developers to profit from a large pool of reusable libraries. Traditionally, the platform-independence of Java always made it easy to publish and share ready-to-use libraries. As Kotlin and Android developers, we also profit from this existing catalogue of libraries. However, new challenges for dealing with dependencies in the JVM world emerged over the past years, as software systems grew further in complexity and new platforms, such as Kotlin or Android, emerged.

Dependency management is one of the major functionalities of the Gradle Build Tool. Gradle 5 offers a number of new stable features to support developers in managing dependencies â€“ and more can be expected soon.

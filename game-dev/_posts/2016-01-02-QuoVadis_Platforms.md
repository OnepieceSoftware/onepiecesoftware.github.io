_Quo Vadis Game Developer Conference, Berlin_

In game development, we always talk about platforms. Developers talk about platforms, business people talk about platforms… everyone talks about platforms. "Platform" became a buzzword with many different meanings. Sometimes it has a positive context expressed by the idea of "a platform we can build on". Yet this isn’t the case for mobile development as it often has a negative connotation, with many focusing on the "different platforms we need to address". In this talk, I want to unravel the jungle of platform terminology in mobile game projects. I will do that by analyzing concrete examples from two projects I worked on at InnoGames that used different technologies.

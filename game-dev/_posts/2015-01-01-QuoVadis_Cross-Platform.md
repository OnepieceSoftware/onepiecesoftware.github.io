_Quo Vadis Game Developer Conference, Berlin_

We take a closer look at different aspects of cross-platform mobile game development on the example of the MMO Tribal Wars 2. Starting from the technology decisions for the mobile versions, over building up a team and process to develop and maintain different versions of the game in parallel, the launch of the game on different platforms, up to the continuous development on the live game. Based on the experiences gained, we discuss alternative software architectures and processes.

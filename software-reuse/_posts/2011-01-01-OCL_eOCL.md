In the past years, many OCL tools achieved a transition
of OCL from a language meant to constrain UML models to a universal
constraint language applied to various modelling and metamodelling
languages. However, OCL users still experience a discrepancy between
the now highly extensible parsing and evaluation backend of OCL tools
and the lack of appropriate frontend tooling like advanced OCL editors
that adapt to the different application scenarios.

We argue that this has to be addressed both at a technical and methodological
level. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of the technical
foundations to provide an integrated OCL tooling frontend and backend
for arbitrary textual modelling languages and contributes a stepwise
process for such an integration. We distinguish two kinds of integration:
external definition of OCL constraints and embedded definition of OCL
constraints. Due to the textual notation of OCL the second kind provides
particularly deep integration with textual modelling languages. We apply
our approach in two case studies and discuss the benefits and limitations
of the approach in general and both integration kinds in particular.

The trend toward domain-specific languages leads to an ever-growing plethora
of highly specialized languages. Developers of such languages focus on their specific
domains rather than on technical challenges of language design. Generic
features of languages are rarely included in special-purpose languages. One very
important feature is the ability to formulate partial programs in separate encapsulated
entities, which can be composed into complete programs in a well-defined
manner. This paper presents a language-independent approach for adding useful
constructs for defining components. We discuss the underlying concepts and describe
a composition environment and tool supporting these ideas – the Reuseware
Composition Framework. To evaluate our approach we enrich the (Semantic) Web
query language Xcerpt with an additional useful reuse concept—modules.

Reuse is an important means of reducing costs and effort
during the development of complex software systems. A major challenge
is to find suitable components in a large library with reasonable effort.
This becomes even harder in today’s development practice where a variety
of artefacts such as models and documents play an equally important
role as source code. Thus, different types of heterogeneous components
exist and require consideration in a component search process. One
flexible approach to structure (software component) libraries is _faceted
classification_. Faceted classifications and in particular _faceted browsing_
are nowadays widely used in online systems. This paper takes a fresh
approach towards using faceted classification in heterogeneous software
component libraries by transferring faceted browsing concepts from the
web to software component libraries. It presents an architecture and implementation
of such a library. This implementation is used to evaluate
the applicability of facets in the context of an industry-driven case study.

Domain Specific Models with graphical syntax play a big
role in Model-Driven Software Development, as do model
composition tools. Those tools however, often ignore or destroy
layout information which is vital for graphical models.
We believe that one reason for the insufficient support for
layout information in model composition tools is the lack
of generic solutions that are easy to adapt for new graphical
modelling languages. Therefore, this paper proposes
a language-independent framework for layout preservation
and composition as an extension to existing model composition
frameworks. We describe the single components of the
framework and evaluate it in combination with the Reuseware
Composition Framework for layout compositions in two
different industrial used languages. We discuss the results
of this evaluation and the next steps to be taken.

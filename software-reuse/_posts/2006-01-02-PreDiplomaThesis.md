Many of today’s languages used in software engineering have bad built-in support for

and tools to define, reuse and compose software components. Still, many languages
available today for programming, modeling, markup, scripting and rule writing do not
support a proper way of defining components — a _component model_. They do not
include concepts about how to compose components — a _composition language_ — and
thus there are no tools for these languages to execute compositions — a _composition

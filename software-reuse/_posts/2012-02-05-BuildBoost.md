_Open Source Project_

BuildBoost is a Java-based open-source framework and meta-build tool that rigorously follows the concept of 'convention over configuration' to enable minimal-to-zero build configurations. One may say that BuildBoost implements the ideas that originally drove the development of Maven (in the context of Eclipse/OSGi).

Designing Domain Specific Languages through metamodeling
is an emerging engineering technique in software development.
Language development, however, is also always
tool development—which can be costly when languages are
developed from scratch. Costs can be saved by developing
new languages as extensions of existing ones—effectively by
extending metamodels. Here, existing tools, developed for
the existing language, can be reused to a certain degree. We
argue that a certain group of metamodel extension is harmless:
keeping existing tools functional, while integrating new
tools to handle additional functionalities. To realize a platform
for this, two things are required: 1) a transformation
engine for the metamodel extension and 2) a synchronization
mechanism for tool integration. In this paper we show
how Triple Graph Grammars can be used to define both and
introduce an interpreter for these grammars that works in
an environment based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework.

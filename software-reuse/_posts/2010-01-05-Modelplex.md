_MODELPLEX – Modelling solution for complex software system_

MODELPLEX has three major objectives:

- Objective A: Develop an open solution for complex systems engineering improving quality and productivity;
- Objective B: Lead its industrialisation;
- Objective C: Ensure its successful adoption by the industry.

Model-driven engineering (MDE) is an approach that is gaining acceptance in several software domains with proven benefits such as cost reduction and quality improvement. However, applicability to complex systems engineering still remains a challenge. This is despite complex systems having an even greater need for model-based approaches because models can provide the necessary abstractions that enable human comprehension, communication, simulation and analysis, and synthesis of implementation artefacts for such systems.

MODELPLEX will define and develop a coherent infrastructure specifically for the application of MDE to the development and subsequent management of complex systems within a variety of industrial domains, where complexity is characterized by a combination of size, heterogeneity, legacy system management, dynamicity, distribution and autonomy of systems.

MODELPLEX will use established MODELWARE technologies as a basis for providing this second-generation MDE approach to solving complex systems engineering problems and will combine substantial innovations in model engineering technology, validation and verification, as well as system management and control. MODELPLEX is organised into two phases of 18 months, each phase delivering significantly innovative and implemented open solutions. The first phase will build and deliver appropriate MDE solutions for complex systems and prepare their consolidation within selected industrial domains.

To achieve the objectives, a consortium of 22 complementary partners of internationally recognized experts in MDE has been setup. It includes major leaders of software intensive industry firms, tool vendors, academia and consultancy companies based in 8 countries.

A large number of different composition systems and techniques
have been developed over the last years. To compare
their relative benefits and drawbacks, we need a common
vocabulary for describing elements of composition systems.
This paper contributes to the search for such a vocabulary
by taking a closer look at the structure of composition
languages—that is, languages used for describing
compositions—based on a survey of eight different composition
systems.

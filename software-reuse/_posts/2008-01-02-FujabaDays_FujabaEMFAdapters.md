title: Letting EMF Tools Talk to Fujaba through Adapters
category: research paper

_In Proc. of 6th International Fujaba Days_

Many software modelling tools are built on top of the Eclipse
Modeling Framework (EMF) through which they can communicate
and exchange models. In contrast to that, the Fujaba
Toolsuite defines its own modelling framework. Both
frameworks are built on the same concepts of software modelling.
Therefore, they can be adapted. This paper presents
an implementation of a generic adapter layer that adapts Fujabaâ€™s
modelling framework to EMF. Through this adapter
layer, Fujaba models can be processed by any EMF-based
tool without adapting each of those tools individually.

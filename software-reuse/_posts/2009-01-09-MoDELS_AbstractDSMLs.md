Domain-specific languages (DSLs) can simplify the development
of complex software systems by providing domain-specific abstractions.
However, the complexity of some domains has led to a number of
DSLs that are themselves complex, limiting the original benefits of using
DSLs. We show how to develop DSLs as abstractions of other DSLs by
transfering translational approaches for textual DSLs into the domain
of modelling languages. We argue that existing model transformation
languages are at too low a level of abstraction for succinctly expressing
transformations between abstract and concrete DSLs. Patterns identified
in such model transformations can be used to raise the level of abstraction.
We show how we can allow part of the transformation to be
expressed using the concrete syntax of the concrete DSL.

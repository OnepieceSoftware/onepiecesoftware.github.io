With Fujaba4Eclipse the Fujaba Tool Suite is intergrated
into the Eclipse Platform. Through this integration,
Fujaba benefits from the stable and well-documented
Eclipse infrastructure and from re-use of some Eclipse tools,
such as the Graphical Editing Framework (GEF). Still,
there are other powerful Eclipse technologies, which could
be enabled in Fujaba. We show, how this can be done by the
Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). More exactly,
we demonstrate, how the EMF’s metamodel Ecore is used
to define EMF-complient Fujaba metamodels. The benefit
is twofold. First, Fujaba technologies (e.g., pattern recognition)
can be applied to EMF models directly in Eclipse.
Second, existing EMF-based tools and applications become
applicable to Fujaba models.

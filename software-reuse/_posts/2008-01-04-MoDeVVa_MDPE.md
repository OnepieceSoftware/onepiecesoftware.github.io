Late identification of performance problems can lead to significant
additional development costs. Hence, it is necessary to address
performance in several development phases by performing a performance
engineering process. We show that Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)
specifics can be utilised for performance engineering. Therefore, we propose
a process combining MDE and performance engineering called ModelDriven
Performance Engineering (MDPE).

Additionally we present our first experiences in application of MDPE
concepts

Domain-specific modelling (DSM) environments enable experts
in a certain domain to actively participate in model-driven development.
Developing DSM environments need to be cost-efficient, since
they are only used by a limited group of domain experts. Different model-driven
technologies promise to allow this cost-efficient development. [1]
presented experiences in developing a DSM environment for telecommunication
network modelling. There, challenges were identified that
need to be addressed by other new modelling technologies. In this paper,
we now present the results of addressing one of theses challenges—
abstraction and reuse support—with the Reuseware Composition Framework.
We show how we identified the abstraction and reuse features required
in the telecommunication DSM environment in a case study and
extended the existing environment with these features using Reuseware.
We discuss the advantages of using this technology and propose a process
for further improving the abstraction and reuse capabilities of the DSM
environment in the future.

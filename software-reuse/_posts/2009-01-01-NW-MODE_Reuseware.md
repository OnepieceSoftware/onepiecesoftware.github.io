In Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) all artifacts that
are created during development can be regarded as parts of the final system.
Thus, these artifacts can be seen as components of the system in the sense of
Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE). There, software is split into
units such that different concerns are separated. Each functionality of the system
can be tracked to the component it is implemented by and therefore fixed, exchanged,
extended or individually reused. While in traditional composition systems
the components operate independently at run-time, MDSD models are integrated
at different points during development time by model transformations.
Through this, the advantages mentioned are often lost; and problems occur when
one of the components is changed either directly or indirectly during development
of a system. This paper proposes an approach that integrates advantages
from CBSE into MDSD. In particular the refinements performed during modeldriven
development are regarded as compositions supported by composition systems.
The approach is based on our Reuseware formalism and exemplified on a
concrete MDSD process.

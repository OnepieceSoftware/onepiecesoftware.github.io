Modern software development uses lots of so-called domain-specific
languages (DSLs), providing domain-specific abstractions as a means to cope
with the increasing complexity of modern software systems. While such languages
are developed with a strong focus on the domain issues they are to address,
more technical considerations of language engineering are typically left
out. This can become problematic when the size of descriptions or programs in
such a DSL increases, leading eventually to a need for advanced modularisation
techniques, such as aspect orientation. To counter the complexities involved
in designing modularisation for every new DSL, this paper shows a generic approach
for implementing aspect orientation for arbitrary languages. The approach
is especially useful for declarative DSLs, but can be used for other languages as
well.

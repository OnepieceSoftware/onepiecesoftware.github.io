Textual Syntax (TS) as a form of model representation has
made its way to the Model-Driven Software Development community and
is considered a viable alternative to graphical representations. To support
the design and implementation of text editing facilities many concrete
syntax and model mapping tools have emerged. Despite the maturity
of these tools, users still spend considerable effort to specify syntaxes
and generate editors even for simple metamodels. To reduce this effort,
we propose to refine a specification that is automatically derived from a
given metamodel. We argue that defaults in a customisable setting enable
developers to quickly realise text-based editors for models. In particular
in settings where metamodels evolve, such a procedure is beneficial. To
evaluate this idea we present EMFText, an EMF/Eclipse integrated
tool for agile TS development. We show how default syntax can easily
be tailored and refined to obtain a custom text editor for EMF models
and demonstrate our approach by two examples.

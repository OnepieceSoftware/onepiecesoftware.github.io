The Dresden Open Software Toolbox (DropsBox)
is a software modelling toolbox consisting of a set
of open source tools developed by the Software Technology
Group at TU Dresden. The DropsBox is built
on top of the Eclipse Platform and the Eclipse Modeling
Framework. The DropsBox contributes to the development
and application of domain-specific languages
(DSLs) in model-driven software development. It can
be customised by tool and language developers to support
various activities of a DSL’s life cycle ranging from
language design to language application and evolution.
In this paper, we provide an overview of the DSL life
cycle, the DropsBox tools, and their interaction on a
common example. Furthermore, we discuss our experiences
in developing and integrating tools for DropsBox
in an academic environment.

In our previous work we proposed Model-Driven Performance
Engineering (MDPE) as a methodology to integrate performance engineering
into the model-driven engineering process. MDPE enables domain
experts, who generally lack performance expertise, to profit from
performance engineering by automating the performance analysis process
using model transformations. A crucial part of this automated process
is to give performance prediction feedback not based on internal models,
but on models the domain experts understand. Hence, a mechanism
is required to annotate analysis results back into the original models
provided by the domain experts. This paper discusses various existing
traceability methodologies and describes their application and extension
for MDPE by taking its specific needs into account.

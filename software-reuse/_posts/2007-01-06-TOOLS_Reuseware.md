The trend towards domain-specific languages leads to an ever-growing plethora of highly
specialized languages. Developers of such languages focus on their specific domains
rather than on technical challenges of language design. Generic features of languages
are rarely included in special-purpose languages. One very important feature is modularization,
the ability to formulate partial programs in separate entities, composable into a
complete program in a defined manner. This paper presents a generic approach for adding
modularity to arbitrary languages, discussing the underlying concepts and presenting the
Reuseware Composition Framework. We walk through an example based on Xcerpt, a
Semantic Web query language.

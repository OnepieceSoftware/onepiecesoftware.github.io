In this paper we present CommentTemplate, which realizes
code generation features, as known from many model-driven development
tools, as a Java language extension. This paper first introduces
CommentTemplate and discusses its features and limitations. Second,
it discusses CommentTemplate as an example of (a) a tool that makes
concepts from model-driven development easily accessible for Java programmers
and (b) a powerful and stable tool that was realized in a short
time thanks to Eclipse modeling technology.

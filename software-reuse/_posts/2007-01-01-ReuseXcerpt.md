Even with all the progress in Semantic technology, accessing Web
data remains a challenging issue with new Web query languages and approaches
appearing regularly. Yet most of these languages, including W3C approaches
such as XQuery and SPARQL, do little to cope with the explosion of the data
size and schemata diversity and richness on the Web. In this paper we propose
a straightforward step toward the improvement of this situation that is simple to
realize and yet effective: Advanced module systems that make partitioning of (a)
the evaluation and (b) the conceptual design of complex Web queries possible.
They provide the query programmer with a powerful, but easy to use high-level
abstraction for packaging, encapsulating, and reusing conceptually related parts
(in our case, rules) of a Web query. The proposed module system combines ease
of use thanks to a simple core concept, the partitioning of rules and their consequences
in flexible “stores”, with ease of deployment thanks to a reduction
semantics. We focus on extending the rule-based Semantic Web query language
Xcerpt with such a module system though the same approach can be applied to
other (rule-based) languages as well.

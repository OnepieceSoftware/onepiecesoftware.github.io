title: Developing a Model Composition Framework with Fujaba – An Experience Report
category: research paper

_In Proc. of 7th International Fujaba Days_

Reuseware is an open-source model composition framework
for composing models defined in arbitrary Ecore-based languages.
In its four years of development, Reuseware has
experienced many extensions and refactorings due to the
integration of new research results and requirements. One
year ago, a redevelopment of Reuseware’s core was started.
Thanks to its EMF code generation, Fujaba was introduced
as a new development tool into Reuseware’s development
toolchain to replace major parts of Java coding through
story driven modelling. With this we solved problems with
behavior modelling and code generation we faced in the development
so far. This paper summarizes our experiences
in developing with Fujaba and suggests improvements for
Fujaba and its EMF code generation based on that.

Annotation of programs using embedded Domain-Specific
Languages (embedded DSLs), such as the program annotation facility for
the Java programming language, is a well-known practice in computer
science. In this paper we argue for and propose a specialized approach
for the usage of embedded Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (embedded
DSMLs) in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) processes that in
particular supports automated many-step model transformation chains.
It can happen that information defined at some point, using an embedded
DSML, is not required in the next immediate transformation step,
but in a later one. We propose a new approach of model annotation enabling
flexible many-step transformation chains. The approach utilizes a
combination of embedded DSMLs, trace models and a megamodel. We
demonstrate our approach based on an example MDE process and an
industrial case study.
